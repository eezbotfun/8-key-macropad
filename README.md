# What is it?
All the power of a Stream Deck, now with tactile mechanical keys, wireless freedom, and full DIY customization.

# Why make it?
The Stream Deck is cool and feature-rich, but its soft buttons lack the satisfying feedback of mechanical keys — and it can't go wireless. That's why we created a DIY alternative: a powerful macropad with tactile mechanical keys, wireless connectivity, and full customization.

# Pros Compared to Stream Deck

## Wireless & Plug-and-Play
No software or drivers needed; works instantly.

## HID Mode Support
Functions as a standard HID device, allowing use even at computer startup — perfect for logging in without any background programs.

## Ultra-Fast Communication
Uses ESP-NOW for low-latency, reliable performance.

## 3.5-inch Full Display
Provides a larger, more visually appealing screen for key functions and animations.

## Mechanical Keys
High-quality mechanical switches offer a much better typing and tactile experience than Stream Deck, improving overall user interaction.

## Open Script Support
Users can write scripts to achieve virtually any function, making it highly customizable and fun to play with.

## 3D Printable Cases
3D files provided, allowing users to print their own cases in different colors and styles.

## User Presets Community
Share and download key presets with other users, making it easy to set up your keyboard your way.

## Affordable
High functionality without the premium price of commercial alternatives.

# How to use
The eezBotFun macro pad is actually a standard HID device, so it works out of the
box with most of the Windows, MacOS and Linux computers when you use it as a simple
shortcut macro pad (HID Mode).
Additionally you can use it as a control panel (Non-HID Mode) as well. But similar to stream deck,
you need to keep the configure app running in background to make some advanced features work.
The table below illustrates which features support HID Mode.

Please keep in mind you need run configure app running in the background when using (Non-HID Mode) features.

# Configure APP
