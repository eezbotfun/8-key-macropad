# What is it?
This is not only a macro pad but also kind of a desktop control center (inspired by Stream Deck) with 3.5 inch LCD.
You can view it as a DIY version of Stream Deck, Yet improved by using Hot-Swappable switches and support HID mode which Stream Deck can not. 

# Why make it?
I bought a 12 key macro pad to simplify my daily work on PC. It works great, but I always forget the key function especially when that key is not used for a while. So the idea of making a macro pad with a LCD to dynamically show the functionality comes to my mind.

# Features

 Stream Deck Functionality ( Launching APP / Openning folder / Accessing Website / PC status Displaying / ... )

# How to use
The eezBotFun macro pad is actually a standard HID device, so it works out of the
box with most of the Windows, MacOS and Linux computers when you use it as a simple
shortcut macro pad (HID Mode).
Additionally you can use it as a control panel (Non-HID Mode) as well. But similar to stream deck,
you need to keep the configure app running in background to make some advanced features work.
The table below illustrates which features support HID Mode.

Please keep in mind you need run configure app running in the background when using (Non-HID Mode) features.
