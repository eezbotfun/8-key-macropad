This is the configuration app for the macro pad, currently only windows OS is supported.

If you want to use stream deck - like features, such as launching app, opening folder, simulate mouse moving, etc. this app must be running in the background.
If you just want to use it as a macro pad, please check 'HID mode' when configuring. Then there is no need to run this app in the background. Please note that the 'HID mode' is on a single key basis instead of a global settings.

If you computer does not have .net 8 runtime, it will prompt you to download the runtime from official Microsfot websit. Just download and install it to make it run. You can also download our self-contained (.net 8 runtime) package at https://www.itsmartreach.com/dl/eezbotfun_config.exe (Due to the 25M size limit of the github, we can't put it here)

Administrative privilege is required to run the app.
