Curently ony windows is supported.
If you want to use stream deck - like features, such as launching app, opening folder, simulate mouse moving, etc. this app must be running in the background.
If you just want to use it as a macro pad, please check 'HID mode' when configuring. Then there is no need to run this app in the background.
