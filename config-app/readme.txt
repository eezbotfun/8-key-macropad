# How to use it
This is the configuration app for the macro pad, currently only windows OS is supported. Just unzip then select the exe file to run, administrative privilege is required to run the app.
If your computer does not have .net 8 runtime, it will prompt you to download the runtime from official Microsfot websit. Just download and install it to make it run. You can also download our self-contained (.net 8 runtime) package at https://www.itsmartreach.com/dl/eezbotfun_config.exe (Due to the 25M size limit of the github, we can't put it here)

# When to run
If you want to use stream deck - like features, such as launching app, opening folder, simulate mouse moving, etc. this app must be running in the background.
If you just want to use it as a macro pad, please check 'HID mode' when configuring. Then there is no need to run this app in the background. Please note that the 'HID mode' is on a single key basis instead of a global settings.
