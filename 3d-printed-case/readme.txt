This is 3D printing housing for eezbotfun  8 key macro pad with 3.5 inch LCD.
For the top housing, I oriented top surface upside on the plate, which has a decent looking.
Recommend using the 0.16 layer height, adding just a little printing time but has a more smooth surface.
You need 4 x M2 Brass Hot Melt Insert Nuts, and 4x M2x12mm countersunk bolt to hold top and bottom housing together.
