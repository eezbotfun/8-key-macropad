There are 3 ways to configure the macropad:

1. Using the dedicate EezBotFun Config APP
   This is the easiest way but only windows is supported.

2. Using online website
   Os indepentend, only requirement is that the web browser support USB-Serial. Such as chrome, safari and edge.

3. Hacking
   Write the script then put it under device's scripts folder, that 's all. Refer to scripat quick start ( https://github.com/eezbotfun/8-key-macropad/blob/main/user-manual/EezBotFun%20Script%20Quick%20Start.pdf )
   Copy the icon you want to the device's app_icons folder to if you want to customise the display. Refer to User Mannual (https://github.com/eezbotfun/8-key-macropad/blob/main/user-manual/EezBotFun%208%20Key%20Macropad%20User%20Manual.pdf) for the naming and format of the icon file.
